- What problem are you solving? What question are you answering?
    Fire bad. predict likelihood of fires?

We might not always get the best predictors - however, building modification permits contain proxies for a lot of relevant information.
Can also predict whether a building's fires per year will increase.

    Record of building permits since 2004
    Record of fires since 2003

    Predict increasing fire rates? or just whether or not there's a fire?

WHY?
    Fire bad. Let's get better at predicting and understanding fire.
    I used building modification permit data to predict. Building modification permit applications include a lot of data about a building. It can indicate what type of building it is, the size and rough population density, and the types of modifications can potentially indicate the age of a building.

    In particular, the age of a building generally isn't readily available.

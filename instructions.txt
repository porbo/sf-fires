Notes:

Run get_data.py to download and process data.

If needed, add the argument loc to geocode the addresses of permits, and add the argument maketarget to construct arrays of counts of fires before and after each permit was issued.
This takes a long time and the results should already be in the repository.

Ex:
```
python get_data.py loc maketarget
```
